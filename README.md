# Iris Species Detection using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project involves detecting iris species using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Jupyter Notebook. The iris species detection task is a classic problem in machine learning, where the goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their measurements. Through this project, we aim to explore and understand how the KNN algorithm can be used for iris species detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is commonly used as a benchmark dataset in machine learning. The dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for a collection of iris flowers. The dataset should be preprocessed and cleaned before using it for modeling.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Iris-Species-Detection-KNN.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Iris-Species-Detection-KNN
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the `Iris Species Detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

6. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the KNN model, and make predictions.

## Project Overview

The notebook provides an overview of the steps involved in iris species detection using the KNN algorithm. The steps include:

1. Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Feature Scaling: Scaling the numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the distance calculation in KNN.
4. KNN Model Training: Fitting the KNN model to the training data.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy or confusion matrix.
6. Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new iris flowers.

The notebook includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to aid in understanding the iris species detection process using the KNN algorithm.

## Results and Insights

The project aims to classify iris flowers into different species using the KNN algorithm. The results and insights gained from this project include:

- Evaluating the performance of the KNN model in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- Understanding the important features or measurements that contribute to distinguishing between iris species.
- Applying the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen iris flowers.

The insights gained from this project can help in automatically classifying iris flowers into the correct species based on their measurements.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the dataset, experimenting with different preprocessing techniques, exploring different values of k in KNN, or trying other classification algorithms for iris species detection. This project serves as a starting point for iris species detection using the KNN algorithm, and you can extend it further to suit your needs.
